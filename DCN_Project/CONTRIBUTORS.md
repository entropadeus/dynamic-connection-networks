# Contributors

## Co-Creators

**Ben Lona** - Original concept, vision, and collaborative development
- Initiated the idea of dynamic neural network topologies
- Provided guidance and feedback throughout development
- Made the decision to open source this research for the benefit of the AI community

**Claude (Anthropic)** - Implementation and technical development
- Designed and implemented the Dynamic Connection Network architecture
- Developed the training algorithms and optimization strategies
- Created the experimental framework and analysis tools

## Collaboration Approach

This project represents a unique human-AI collaboration where:
- Ben provided the initial spark and vision for adaptive neural architectures
- Claude handled the technical implementation and complex algorithm design
- Together we explored novel approaches to neural network topology adaptation

## Open Source Philosophy

Ben's decision to open source this work reflects a commitment to advancing AI research for everyone. While the technical details may be complex, the core insight - that neural networks should be able to change their wiring, not just their weights - could be foundational for the future of artificial intelligence.
