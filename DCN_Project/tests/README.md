# DCN Tests

Unit tests and validation for Dynamic Connection Networks.

## Running Tests

```bash
python test_dcn.py
```

## Test Coverage

- **Basic DCN functionality** - Network creation and forward pass
- **Dynamic topology changes** - Connection adaptation during training
- **Cross-task transfer** - Topology reuse across different problems
- **Memory efficiency** - Resource usage validation
- **Feature specialization** - Analysis of learned patterns

## Test Results

Tests validate that DCNs can:
✅ Learn different topologies for different tasks
✅ Transfer knowledge across related problems  
✅ Maintain performance while adapting structure
✅ Efficiently share weights across tasks

## Adding New Tests

When contributing new DCN features, please add corresponding tests to ensure reliability and reproducibility of results.
